settings:
append in new line
show sent time stamp
show index of each byte ???[0]b1, [1]b2 ...
choose font color - green or white
encoding - ascii, utf, raw bytes etc...
logging to file
send trainling <nl - new line> for each message sent
command line character, i.e $, #, !


handle memory when there is a lot of lines


command line:
filter,
send range
send file - loop or once
send raw bytes in packet
get ideas from termie
add timestamp for each read
sending ping
check range - insert start and end number, and the window will print arrow if some bytes are missing in the range (jumps of 1)
auto baud rate finder - if more than 50 percent is "?" than its wrong baud rate (if suppose to be strings println)

about form
green marker when connected, red when not

limit bytes lables by size
turn B unit to KB and MB and so on when a lot of bytes incoming


tests:
server closes comm first
client closes comm first
trying to connect disconnect then connect again
entering invalid values
pressing buttons in the wrong order

when client disconnect from tcp - how to recognize it?

graph indicator can display amount of incoming data rate, or connected to number that im getting in, and display values of this number, and setpoint
zoom in or out from graph

return connection failed if it failed

When working with connections, you need a quick and easy way of monitoring and testing them. \n Falcom allows you to do exactly that

enter on port or ip window = connect button
when sending fails dont count bytes
handle connetcions excepotions
handle trying connect to serial with no port selected
