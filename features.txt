settings:
append in new line
show sent time stamp
show index of each byte ???[0]b1, [1]b2 ...
choose font color - green or white
encoding - ascii, utf, raw bytes etc...
logging to file
send trainling <nl - new line> for each message sent
command line character, i.e $, #, !


handle memory when there is a lot of lines


command line:
filter,
send range
send file - loop or once
send raw bytes in packet
get ideas from termie
add timestamp for each read
sending ping
check range - insert start and end number, and the window will print arrow if some bytes are missing in the range (jumps of 1)
auto baud rate finder - if more than 50 percent is "?" than its wrong baud rate (if suppose to be strings println)

about form
green marker when connected, red when not

enter key needs to be the same as hitting send button
limit bytes lables by size
turn B unit to KB and MB and so on when a lot of bytes incoming


tests:
server closes comm first
client closes comm first
trying to connect disconnect then connect again
entering invalid values
pressing buttons in the wrong order


bytes out lable not yet working
when sending or recving bytes, bytes out and in light up in green for 1 second and then turn back off

tcp,udp,ser indications not yet working

when client disconnect from tcp - how to recognize it?

save all connection settings after each session

commands that are sent out are added to console with red/yellow color

graph indicator can display amount of incoming data rate, or connected to number that im getting in, and display values of this number, and setpoint
zoom in or out from graph



next things:
Serial tested --OK
reset bytes counter when number is too big

return connection failed if it failed
