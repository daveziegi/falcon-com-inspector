#### 1.1 Connections

here you can chose the type of connection protocol you want to listen / publish to. For TCP and UDP connection you can open either a client or a server. When choosing server, IP text box will disapear, because it is determined automatically by the PC current IP.
When listening on a TCP server, an indication "Incoming clients" show you how many clients are connected to you.
On Serial connection, the "COM:" list will be filled with available usb serial connections. Choose one and set the serial settings according to your needs.

Note: At all times, only a single connection is allowed.
